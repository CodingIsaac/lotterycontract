This is a Lottery Solidity Contract.


We are creating a lottery smart contract. So what are we considering:
1. An only manager function
2. Declaring an address of arrays to collect all the addresses involved in the lottery
3. Consider mapping addresses to the amount of ether deposited, to keep tract of tokens deposited for the lottery
4. Declare a function that can generate random winners during the contest.
5. create a function to get the balance of the lottery contract.
6. Require that the only person that can transfer is the manager;
7. Require that the length of the lottery players is 10
